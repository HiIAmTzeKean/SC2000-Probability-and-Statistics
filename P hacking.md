# P hacking

Misuse of analysis techniques to obtain false positives. In relation to the [[Multiple testing problem]] and can be reduced with [[False discovery rate]].

Another trap is the when additional data points is added to the set of data collected in order to check if the p-value would change for larger sample size. (Theoretically proven that doing so will likely result in a false positive)
