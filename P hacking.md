# P hacking

It is the misuse of the data to make [[Inference]] that are statistically significant to understate the risk through obtaining false positives. In relation to the [[Multiple testing problem]] and can be reduced with [[False discovery rate]]. Also known as data dredging. 

Another trap is the when additional data points is added to the set of data collected in order to check if the p-value would change for larger sample size. (Theoretically proven that doing so will likely result in a false positive)
