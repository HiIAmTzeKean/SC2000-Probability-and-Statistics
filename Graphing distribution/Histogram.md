# Histogram

> [!Note]
> Typically used for [[Continuous random variable]]

Different number of bins can produce different interpretation as it changes the shape of the histogram.

## Types of frequencies

1. [[Absolute frequency]]
    1. Represented by actual number of frequency for each interval
2. [[Relative frequency]]
    1. Represented by proportion of frequency to total frequency
    2. Range of frequency is $0<=x<=1$

## Class interval

Rule of thumb:
$$\text{No. of class interval} = \sqrt{\text{No. of data}}$$

## Creating histogram

1. Calculate the range of scores
    1. $MaxScore - MinScore$
2. Create class interval
3. Count scores in each interval
4. Represent frequencies with bars
