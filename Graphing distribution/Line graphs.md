# Line graphs

[[Bar graph]] with the top of the bar represented by points joined by lines.

## Properties

1. Correct only when x and y axis are [[Quantitative]]
2. Better than bar graphs at comparing changes over time

## Pitfall

The ordering on the x-axis gives the impression that the data is ordered, which is not the case. This mistake can occur with [[Qualitative]] graph, where each category has no natural order but the line conveys a different visual interpretation.
