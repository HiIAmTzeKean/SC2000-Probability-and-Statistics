# Stem and leaf

Purpose: clarifies the shape of the plot, hence revealing the distribution

Stems can be split such when the rows get to long to better illustrate the distribution.

Another variation of the stem and lead is the "back to back stem and leaf". It compares the distribution of 2 different datasets.
