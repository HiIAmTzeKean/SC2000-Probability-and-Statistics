# Bar graph

## Properties

- Used for [[Discrete variable]]
- Good for showing frequencies of categories and [[Qualitative]] data
    - Allows for comparison of the frequencies for each category

## Pitfalls

- Bar graph using images can mislead audience on the frequency
    - Volume of the image may be a few times larger, but the actual increase may just be a few percentage points -> [[Lie factor]]
- Misleading baseline
    - When the base of the bar graph does not start with 0
