# Degree of freedom

The number of independent pieces of information the evidence is based.

## Formula

$$\text{Degree of freedom} = \text{number of values} - \text{number of parameters estimated to obtain target estimation}$$

For instance, to estimate [[Variability#Variance|Variance]], we must first obtain [[Measure of centre tendency#Mean]]. Given a sample size N, the degree of freedom is $N-1$.
