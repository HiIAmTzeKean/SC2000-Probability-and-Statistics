# Confidence interval

A range of score that will likely contain the [[Parameter]] being estimated. Typically containing the population value 95% or 99% of the time, representing the confidence interval.

## Property

More useful than [[Point estimate]] since it reveals the uncertainty with the estimate.

If repeated samples taken, and 95/99% confidence interval computed for each sample set, 95/99% of intervals of all sets will contain population mean.

## Confidence interval result properties

1. Interval is symmetric about the point estimate
2. Each interval is contiguous
