# Bias

## Sampling method
Sampling method is biased when each element does not have an equal chance of being selected.
## Estimator
Is biased if it systematically overestimates or underestimates the [parameter](Parameter.md) it is estimating. --> long term average value of the statistic is not the parameter it is estimating --> mean of the [sampling distribution](Sampling%20distribution.md) of the [statistic](Statistic.md) does not equal to the [parameter](Parameter.md).
## Machine learning
Error introduced to the [[Machine learning]] model during training. High bias indicates that the model is too simple to capture the hidden patterns in the [[Training data]] and the test data.

High bias can indicate
1. Less [[Flexible model]]
2. Low [[Variance]]
