# Central limit theorem

Sums and mean of random sample from population tends to have an approximated normal distribution.

## Theorem
Sampling distribution of the sum (Sum of sample measurements) will approach [[Normal distribution]] with mean $n*\mu$ and SD $\sigma \sqrt{n}$ as sample size → inf.

Sampling distribution of mean (Mean of sample measurements $\bar{x}$) will approach a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and SD $\frac{\sigma}{n}$ as sample size N → inf.

## Application of theorem
1. If the sample comes from a normal distribution, the [[Sampling distribution of mean]] will always be normal
2. When the sampled population is symmetric, [[Sampling distribution of mean]] approximately normal for small n
3. When sampled population is skewed, n≥30 before [[Sampling distribution of mean]] is approximately normal

## Uses

Allows us to make probability statements about [[Sample mean]] in relation to [[Population mean]]
