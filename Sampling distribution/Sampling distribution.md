# Sampling distribution

Relative frequency distribution with when the number of sets sampled from population approaches infinity.

## Ways to obtain [[Sampling distribution]]
1. Mathematically obtain using [[Probability]]
2. Use of computer simulation
3. Use statistical theorem to approximate values

## Effects of population type on sampling distribution

Sampling distribution of mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size continues to increase by [Central limit theorem](Central%20limit%20theorem.md). Implying that population shape does not affect the sampling distribution of mean when sample size is sufficiently large.
