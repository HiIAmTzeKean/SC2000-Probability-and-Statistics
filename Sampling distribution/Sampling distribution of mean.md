# Sampling distribution of mean

We perform [sampling distribution](Sampling%20distribution.md) of N samples and calculate the mean repeatedly.

## Mean
The mean of the sampling distribution of mean equals to the [[Population mean]].
$$\mu_M=\mu$$
## Variance
Variance of sampling distribution of mean can be obtained below. The variance indicates the error of the the mean of the sampling distribution and the population mean. Larger N reduces the variance from population mean, bringing the probability of the sampling distribution mean closer to $\mu$.

$$\sigma_M^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{N}$$

Expression can be derived by applying [Variance sum law](Variance%20sum%20law.md) and [Variance](Variability.md#Variance) definition. [Proof from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVeeJDgkjrQ&t=370s)

## Standard deviation
Standard deviation of sampling distribution of the mean.
$$\sigma_M = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$$

> [[Standard error of mean]] is standard deviation of sampling distribution of mean
