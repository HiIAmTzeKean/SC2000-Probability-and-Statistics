# Normal distribution

A graph that describe specific [[Probability density function]] which describe the behaviour of a [[Continuous random variable]] in a system. 

## Area

Calculated using a specific [[Probability density function]].Where $\mu$ is the [[Mean]] and $\sigma$ is the [[Standard deviation|Standard error]].

$$f(x) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-0.5(\mu - x)^2/ \sigma^2}$$

Where $\mu$ determines the location of the curve and $\sigma$ determines the shape of the curve.

## Shape

The curve is always symmetric about the mean.

## Approximation of value

Given a [Binomial distribution](Binomial%20distribution.md), we can approximate the probability of an event. The set back is that normal distribution is a continuous distribution, while binomial distributions are discrete.

The calculation of the Z score would be done through the [standard normal distribution formula](Standard%20normal%20distribution.md#Formula) for the upper and lower bound. The approximated probability would then be the area within the bound.
