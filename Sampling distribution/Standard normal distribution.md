# Standard normal distribution

A [[Normal distribution]] of random variable with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Denoted with letter $Z$.

## Formula

Transformation of any value on the curve by the following formula yields the standard normal value. Allowing us to apply the formula.

$$P(Z<z)$$

To obtain the [cumulative probability](Cumulative%20probability.md) of the value being less than $z$ we use map the z-score to a table to obtain the probability of the score occurring.
$$z=\frac{(X-\mu)}{\sigma}$$

## [[Standardization|Standardizing]]

By transforming the [normal distribution curve](Normal%20distribution.md) such that the mean is 0 and the SD is 1, the distribution is standardised.
