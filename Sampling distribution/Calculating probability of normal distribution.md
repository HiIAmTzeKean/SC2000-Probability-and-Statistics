# Calculating probability of normal distribution

For some random variable X

$$P(a<X<b) = P(\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma} < Z < \frac{b-\mu}{\sigma})$$

Where $Z$ is the [[Standard normal distribution]] variable. The new endpoints then denotes the z-score.

## Visual

The [[Normal distribution]] is transformed into [[Standard normal distribution]], although having different limits, the area under the graph is the same.
