# Sampling distribution of difference between mean

## Formula

The sampling distribution of difference between mean is the difference between the population mean.
$$\mu_{M_1-M_2}=\mu_1-\mu_2$$

Using [Variance sum law](Variance%20sum%20law.md), we can also drive the variance of the sampling distribution of the difference between means.

$$\sigma_{M_1-M_2}^2 = \sigma_{M_1}^2 + \sigma_{M_2}^2$$

We can obtain variance of sampling distribution between difference of mean using [Sampling distribution of mean variance formula](Sampling%20distribution.md#Variance).

$$\sigma_{M_1-M_2}^2=\frac{\sigma_{M_1}^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_{M_2}^2}{n_2}$$
