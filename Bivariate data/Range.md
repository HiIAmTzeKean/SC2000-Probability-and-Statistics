# Range

The range is of a [[Matrix]] is its [[Column span]].
## Calculating range
### Through rows
[[Elementary row operations]] can be performed on the [[Matrix]] to obtain the [[Reduced row echelon form]]. [[Pivot column]]s are those [[Linearly independent]] vectors and thus form the span of the matrix. The range is derived from the [[Span]].
### Through columns
A more efficient way is to compute via [[Elementary column operations]]. The [[Reduced column echelon form]] is obtained and all zero columns are deleted.
