# Pearson correlation

Measures the strength of the linear relationship

## Property

1. Symmetric: Correlation of X and Y is the same as Y and X.
2. Unaffected by [linear transformation](Linear%20transformation.md): mX+c transformation with m and c being constants do not change correlation.

## Computing correlation for population
$$\rho = \frac{E[(X-\mu_x) (Y-\mu_y)]} {\sigma_x \sigma_y}$$
#TODO Ready textbook on equal likely chance of x and y part

## Computing correlation for sample

NOTE THAT COV DENOMINATOR IS (N-1)
$$r = \frac{} {s_x s_y}$$
Where the numerator is the sample covariance -> $cov=$
