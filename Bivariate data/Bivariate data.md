# Bivariate data



## Visualisation

### [[Scatter plot]]

Axis of the graph will represent the 2 variables that we are measuring. Line of best fit allows us to find the relationship.

Properties:
1. Relationship can be positive/ negative association
2. Can be linear or non-linear
3. Strength measured with [Pearson correlation](Pearson%20correlation.md)

### [[Histogram]]

We can see the distribution of each shape but unable to compare the datapoints side by side

- Indicate central tendency
- Allows for some comparison
