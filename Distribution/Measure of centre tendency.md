# Measure of centre tendency

## Importance of central tendency
![[central tendency distribution.png]]
Given a student score 3/5, the performance varies depending on the central tendency of the data set. It is important to know the **central tendency** to make meaningful **interpretation** of the score.

## 3 meanings of central tendency

- Point at which a distribution would balance
    - [[Mean]] is the point where distribution will balance
- Value whose average absolute difference is smallest
    - [[Median]]
- Value whose average squared difference is smallest
    - [[Mean]]

## Common measures of central tendency
### Mean

$\mu = \frac {\sum X} {N}$

Refer: [[Sample mean]], [[Population mean]]

### Median

It is the midpoint of distribution -> same number of score above and below median (50th Percentile).

Refer: [[Percentile]], [[Median]]

### Mode

Refer: [[Mode]]

## Usage of measure of centre

- [[Nominal scale]] (mode)
- [[Ordinal scale]] (mode or mean)
- Numerical data (median)
- Numerical data that is symmetric
    - [[Mean]] and [[Median]] are equal
- Bell-shaped normal distribution
    - [[Mean]], [[Median]], [[Mode]] are the same

## Hildebrand rule

$$H=\frac{\bar{x}-\tilde{x}}{s}$$

$\bar{x}$ is sample mean and $\tilde{x}$ is the sample median. s is the standard deviation.

When $|H|<0.2$, data is sufficiently symmetric.
