## [[Trimean]]

Weighted average of 25th, 50th, 75th percentile.

$Trimean=\frac{(P25+2\times P50+P75)}{4}$

## [[Geometric mean]]

Average rate of return of a set of values. Where N in this case is the number of data points supplied.

$\text{Geometric mean} = (\prod X)^\frac{1}{N}$

## [[Trimmed mean]]

Remove some of the higher and lower data points. Trimmed mean of 50% means taking away 25% of data points from both top and bottom.
