# Skew

Tails of a graph are not skews. Skew is the comparison of the relative length of of tails.

- [[Symmetric]] distribution
    - No skew
- Positive skew
    - Tail of graph is towards positive end
- Negative skew 
    - Tail of graph is towards negative end
    - Less commonly seen
- [[Bimodal distribution]]
    - When there are two distinct peaks
- [[Multi-modal distribution]]
    - Graph with multiple peaks

When the graph is positively skewed, the mean will be larger than median. To find the relationship between skew and relative size of the mean and median, we can use several measurements.

Pearson index of skew: $\frac{3(Mean-Median)}{\sigma}$

Third moment about mean: $\sum \frac{(X-\mu)^3}{\sigma ^3}$
