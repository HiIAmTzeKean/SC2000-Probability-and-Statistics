# Interval scale

Names or categories have order and each **interval** has the **same interpretation** compared to [[Ordinal scale]].

## Limitation

- Does not have a true zero point
    - When there is no true zero point, comparison using fractions or ratios make no sense

## Example

- Temperature scale
