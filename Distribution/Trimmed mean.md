# Trimmed mean

Remove some of the higher and lower data points and then computing the [[Mean]]

## Formula

Trimmed mean of 50% means taking away 25% of data points from both top and bottom.

## Relation to [[Median]]

Median trims the upper and bottom 49+% of the scores. In a sense, trimmed mean is a hybrid of mean and median.
