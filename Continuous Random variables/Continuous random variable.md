# Continuous random variable

Where probability is calculated from [[Probability distribution of continuous random variable]]. 

Since the area is the integral of the curve, the area for a particular x is 0 --> An endpoint being included or not makes no difference in the probability calculated.

So for any continuous variable X
$$P(a\le X \le b)=P(a< X \le b)=P(a\le X < b)=P(a<X<b)$$
