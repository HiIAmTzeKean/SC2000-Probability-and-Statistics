# Probability

$Probability = \frac{No. favourable}{No. all outcomes}$

## Probability of 2 events

$P(A\land B)=P(A)\times P(B)$

$P(A\lor B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\land B)$

## Conditional probability

If events of A and B are not independent, then
$$P(A\land B)=P(A) \times P(B|A)$$
Given a question, we must first consider all cases. Then we sum up all cases, taking into account all dependent probabilities.

## Gambler fallacy

What is the probability of getting heads again given that there were 5 heads flipped.

We note that the probability of coin flips are independent from each other, and thus, each event does not affect subsequent events.

## Modelling a [[Distribution]]
Can be done through the specific type of events concerned with [[Probability distribution]]
