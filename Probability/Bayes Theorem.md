# Bayes Theorem

Considers prior probability to determine posterior probability. Thus, when given $P(A|B)$ we can find $P(B|A)$.

## Rule 1
Given 2 events A and B, where $P(A) \ne 0$

$$P(B|A)  = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)} {P(A)}$$

## Rule 2
If there is some partition in the sample space where $B_1, B_2...$ and A is some event where $P(A) \ne 0$ then

$$P(B_j|A) = \frac{P(A|B_j)P(B_j)} {\sum P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}$$
so for some sample space with 2 partition, we can rewrite the equation to
$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B')P(B')}$$
