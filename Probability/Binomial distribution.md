# Binomial distribution

## Formula

Probabilities of each possible number of independent N successful trials. The formula multiples the possible combinations of the 2 cases with the respective probabilities.
$$P(x)=\frac{N!}{x!(N-x)!}\pi ^x (1-\pi)^{N-x}$$
## Formula
### Mean
Where $\pi$ is the probability of success
$$\mu = N\pi$$
### Variance
$$\sigma^2 = N\pi(1-\pi)$$
### [[Standard deviation]]

Since standard deviation is the squared of variance

$$\sigma = \sqrt{N\pi(1-\pi)}$$
