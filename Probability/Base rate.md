# Base rate

When trying to compute the probability of a hit and a miss we need to consider two aspects, **misses** and **false positives**.
## Misses
When an event is classified as a negative when it is a positive.
## False positives
When an event is classified as a positive when it is a negative.
## Base rate
To compute the probability based on the correct proportion of people.
