# Hypergeometric Distribution

## Formula

To calculate probabilities of events without replacement

1. k is total possible number of successes
2. x is number of success in question
3. N is size of population
4. n is number of samples done
5. $\prescript{}{k}C_x$ is the number of 

$$p=\frac{(\prescript{}{k}C_x) (\prescript{}{(N-k)}C_{n-x})} {\prescript{}{N}C_n}$$

$$mean=\frac{n\times k}{N}$$

$$SD=\sqrt{\frac{(n \times k)(N-k)(N-n))}{N^2 (N-1)}}$$
