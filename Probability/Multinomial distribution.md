# Multinomial distribution

## Formula

For calculation of probability of multiple cases in one probability, we can use the following formula.

$$p=\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2!...n_k!}p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}...p_k^{n_k}$$

We note that when there is k=2 probability in question, the formula is equivalent to [Binomial distribution](Binomial%20distribution.md).
