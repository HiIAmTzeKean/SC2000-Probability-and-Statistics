# Inferential statistics

> [!Summary]
> Extrapolation of data to make formal guess on population data.

Reliance on a [[Sample]] to draw inferences about larger set. 

## Considerations

Must be representative of the population and not [[Bias]].

- [[Simple random sampling]]
    - Each member has equal chance of being selected.
- [[Sample size]]
    - Large sample size reflects the population more accurately.
- [[Random assignment]]
    - Prevents [[Systematic error]] or treatment to variables
- [[Stratified sampling]]
    - Identify distinct groups and randomly sample from the groups such that the proportion represents the actual proportion of the population
    - If there are 70% girls and 30% boys, then the sampling should reflect the same proportions.
