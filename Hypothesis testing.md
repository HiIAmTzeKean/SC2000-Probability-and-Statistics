# Hypothesis testing
## Procedure
1. State null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis
    1. Null hypothesis is a prediction that there is no relation between [[Random variable]] being tested
    2. Alternate hypothesis is the initial hypothesis of interest
2. Statistical test
    1. [[Test statistic]] (z-value)
    2. [[p-value]]
4. Decide to reject null hypothesis
## Rejecting null hypothesis
- [[Rejection region]]
- Acceptance region
- [[Critical value]]
- [[Significance level]]

The null hypothesis is rejected when the [[Sample mean]] lies far from the [[Population mean]]. The definition of "far" is defined by the [[Significance level]]. 
## Error in rejection
- [[Type 1 error]]
- [[Type 2 error]]
