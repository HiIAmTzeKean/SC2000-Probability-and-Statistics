# Point estimation

- [[Bias]] vs [[Unbias]]
    - Distance from true value of [[Parameter]] to estimate known as **[[Error of estimation]]** â†’ [[Standard deviation|Standard error]]
- Small variance is optimal

Note the implication of sample size n. Larger n â†’ smaller [[Variance]] â†’ lesser spread of data â†’ estimate closer to true value
