# Point estimation

- [[Bias]] vs [[Unbias]]
    - Distance from true value of [[Parameter]] to estimate known as **[[Error of estimation]]** → [[Standard deviation|Standard error]]
- Small variance is optimal

Note the implication of sample size n. Larger n → smaller [[Variance]] → lesser spread of data → estimate closer to true value
